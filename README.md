# sicp-exercises

This repository is dedicated to solving exercises from the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.

I've also written [some blog posts](https://quantonganh.com/tag/sicp) detailing how I solved them.
