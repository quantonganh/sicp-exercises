1.3.1 Procedures as Arguments

- Procedure abstraction
- Higher-order procedures: a powerful mechanism for creating flexible and modular code
- Procedure composition
- Generalizing procedures
- Anonymous procedures
- Control abstraction

1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using lambda

- anonymous procedures
- procedure abstraction
- higher-order procedures with `lambda`
- closure creation

1.3.3 Procedures as General Methods

- General-purpose procedures
- Procedure composition
- Higher-order procedures (are procedures that can take other procedures as arguments and/or return procedures as results)
- Procedures as arguments to control structures (`if`, `while`, `cond`)
