## 2.2.1 Representing Sequences

1. Sequences as ordered sets: each element has specific position or index.
2. Pairs as sequences: each pair consists of an element and the rest of sequence
3. Mapping sequences to lists: empty list represents the end of sequence
4. Operations on sequences: length, access by index, append
5. Efficiency considerations: trade-offs between time and space efficiency in sequence operations.

## 2.2.2 Hierarchical Structures

1. Nested lists as a representation:  each element of a list can be either an atomic value or another nested list.
2. Recursive procedures: can be used to traverse, access the elements of nested lists
3. Abstraction and hierarchical structures: focus on the overall structure and the relationships between the parts, while hiding the implementation details of individual levels.
4. Mapping procedures over hierarchical structures

## 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces

1. Conventional interfaces: set of procedures and conventions for working with certain types of data
2. Sequences as conventional interfaces: `first`, `rest`, `empty?`, `cons`, `list`
3. Hierarchical sequences: `flatten`, `treemap`
4. Sequence abstractions: to work with sequence without worrying about the underlying representation
5. Implement sequences with different data types: arrays, linked lists
